Week 2 Journal

Part 1 - Individual Accomplishments this Sprint
Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did over the course of this sprint, including the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments

My goal for this week was to make sure all endpoints we will need for the students table are implemented and they are displayed/manipulated in the front end. I created front end components to consume the backend api endpoints that I created last week. I added two new endpoints that we would need later on in the week. I also created a component to view an individual student's information. I then started working on the School Admin dashboard and the required components needed for the dashboard. I created delete, edit, and add student components for the dashboard. I had some trouble getting my edit student component to work the way I wanted it to, but Kevin and Leianne were able to help me work it out. 



Detailed Analysis
Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did. This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and include screenshots if appropriate

For the school admin dashboard, I needed to create add, edit, and delete components. I started with the edit component since I thought it would be the most challenging. I ran into some blockers but was able to sort them out with help from my team. I also wanted to make the edit component a modal, but decided to hold off until next week to implement that in favor of higher priority features. Once I had the basic edit component working, I created the add student component and delete component. I tested all the components individually to ensure that they were communicating with the backend. Once I confirmed the components were working, I then packaged them all together in the admin dashboard. 




Part 2 - Weekly Reflection
As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences forming a team. What did you do to help the team solidify as a group? What did you do that you now realize caused friction in this process? What are you doing personally to make sure that everyone on the team, including you, has a voice in decision making?

This week I've been working on my communication; I've been making an effort to do better at communicating where I'm at with my work on the project and keeping up with what everyone else is working on. I've also tried to make sure that I'm clearly communicating my thoughts and my understanding of the project's goals. Instead of assuming I know what needs to be done, I've started to verify with the team first to ensure that we are all on the same page. I've also been working on being more open to suggestions from the team.
